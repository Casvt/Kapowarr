This page covers how Kapowarr matches certain things.

## Files to Issues

This covers how Kapowarr matches files to issues of a volume. Information is extracted from the filename, folder and parent folder.

If a specific string is required, any common variations are also supported. For example, if the string 'one-shot' is required, the variations 'one shot' and 'os' are also allowed. And upper case or lower case does not matter.
