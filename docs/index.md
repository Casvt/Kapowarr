# Kapowarr Documentation Hub

__Kapowarr is a software to build and manage a comic book library, fitting in the *arr suite of software.__

Kapowarr allows you to build a digital library of comics. You can add volumes, map them to a folder and start managing! Download issues of the volume (or TPB's), rename them and move them. The whole process is automated and can be customised in the settings.

Each day, each volume is checked to see if a new issue has come out and if so, it will immediately be downloaded and added to your library.

## Finding Documentation

In the web-UI of Kapowarr, the documentation for that topic will be found at the same URL path.  
This means for information about the 'File Naming' setting, (found at `YOUR_KAPOWARR/settings/mediamanagement#file-naming`), the docs for that setting can be found at `https://casvt.github.io/Kapowarr/settings/mediamanagement#file-naming`.  
The same goes for features like Library Import and Mass Editor.
