## Regarding the project

### Does Kapowarr support XYZ?

"XYZ" can be "Magazines" or "Manga" or something else. For now, there is a simple answer: if it can be found on ComicVine, you can add it to Kapowarr (and use features like renaming and converting). If GetComics offers downloads for it, you can also download for it.

### When will XYZ be added?

"XYZ" can be "Usenet support" or "Exporting metadata" or something else. First, check out the [project board](https://github.com/users/Casvt/projects/5) to see if it's already on there and if so, at what stage it is. If it's not, check if a feature request is already made for it on the [issues page](https://github.com/Casvt/Kapowarr/issues) and otherwise make a feature request for it there.

## Regarding the usage

### How do I access the web-ui?

Coming Soon.

### Why do certain files pop up in the Library Import, even though I just imported them?

Coming Soon.

### Why does Kapowarr not grab the links from a GC page even though they work fine?

Coming Soon.
